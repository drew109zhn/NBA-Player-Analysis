# NBA Player Analysis
In our project, we analyze professional basketball League dataset with techniques learned from the Data Science course, and study player performances and nationality discrimination issues in NBA. We use python to scrape datasets from ESPN basketball database and basketball-references.com, which include player demographics, player game statistics and yearly salaries. Then we clear our datasets in psql and subsequently conduct empirical experiments in Stata. 

We do not find evidence of nationality discrimination of salary in the NBA but we find that a NBA playerâ€™s age and true shooting percentage have the largest effects on his salary, ceteris paribus

## Project proposal
In our research, we are seeking to analyze Professional Basketball League dataset with techniques learned from the course through this semester. We are proposing to study player performances and discrimination issues in NBA with datasets obtained from ESPN basketball database and basketball-references.com which include player demographics, player game statistics and yearly salaries. Some sample scraped csv files are attached. 
First, we will look at whether aggressive NBA players perform better defensively than less aggressive players, holding other player characteristics constant. We will measure number of fouls committed per minute for a player to represent his aggressiveness. Second, we tend to look at whether there is racial discrimination in NBA, that given the same performances, do black players on average receive less salary than white players? We will include a player’ PER(player efficiency rating), scores, rebounds, assists and steals etc . to measure his game performance. Third, we tend to predict a player’ PER next year given his performances in the current year. Again we will use the same performance measurements from the second question.
